In supervised learning, it is easy to define what relevant feature means. It simply refers to the feature that is capable of distinguishing different classes. For example, a feature fi is said to be relevant to a class cj if fi and cj are highly correlated.

why clustering> -- manual labelling is expensive.- image segmentation, information retrieval, pattern recognition, pattern classification, network analysis etc.

It can be seen as either an exploratory task or preprocessing step. If the
goal is to explore and reveal the hidden patterns in the data, clustering becomes a standalone exploratory task by itself. However, if the generated clusters are going to be used to facilitate another data mining or machine learning task, clustering will be a preprocessing step in this case.
